## Overview
Pacsea is a keyboard‚Äëfirst package explorer for Arch Linux. It unifies official repository and AUR search into a single, responsive TUI, with always‚Äëvisible panes for results, recent searches, an install list, and a rich Package Info view.

> Inspired by workflows from the Omarchy distro, Pacsea focuses on speed, clarity, and minimal keystrokes.

## Features
- ‚ö° Instant, debounced search across official repos and AUR
- üß≠ Three‚Äëpane layout: Results, Recent/Search/Install, Package Info
- üîé In‚Äëpane find (/) for Recent and Install panes
- ‚ûï One‚Äëkey queueing (Space) and batch install confirmation
- üß† Caching of details and local index for faster subsequent usage
- üìù Install log written to `install_log.txt`
- üß™ `--dry-run` mode for safe testing

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Arch Linux (or derivative) with pacman
- `curl` for web fallbacks and AUR requests
- For AUR installs: one of `paru` or `yay` (auto‚Äëdetected)
- Rust toolchain (to build from source)

### Build from source
```bash
# 1) Install Rust (if needed)
sudo pacman -S rustup && rustup default stable

# 2) Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/Firstp1ck/Pacsea
cd Pacsea
cargo build --release
```

### Run
```bash
# Run the optimized binary
./target/release/Pacsea

# Or run in dev mode
cargo run

# Optional: no installs are performed
./target/release/Pacsea --dry-run
```

## Usage
1) Start typing to search. With an empty query, Pacsea shows the official index (after the first refresh).
2) Use Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown to navigate results.
3) Press Space to add the selected package to the Install list.
4) Press Enter to confirm installing the selected (Search) or all (Install) packages.
5) Use the Recent pane to re‚Äërun prior queries; Enter loads the query into Search, Space quickly adds the first match.

The bottom Package Info panel displays rich metadata for the selected item; Pacsea prefetches details for the first few results to keep it snappy.

## Keybindings

| Pane     | Action                         | Keys                         |

| Dialogs  | Confirm / Cancel               | Enter / Esc                  |
| Search   | Move selection                 | ‚Üë / ‚Üì, PageUp / PageDown     |
| Search   | Add to install                 | Space                        |

| Recent   | Use query / Add first match    | Enter / Space                |
| Recent   | Find in pane                   | /, Enter=next, Esc=cancel    |
| Install  | Move selection                 | j / k, ‚Üë / ‚Üì                 |
| Install  | Confirm install all            | Enter                        |
| Install  | Remove selected / Clear all    | Delete / Shift+Delete        |

A compact multi‚Äëline help is also visible at the bottom of Package Info.

## Data sources and performance
- Official repositories
  - Local pacman is preferred for speed: `pacman -Sl` (names) + batched `pacman -Si` (details)
  - Falls back to archlinux.org JSON if needed
  - A background refresh runs at startup; the index is enriched on‚Äëdemand as you browse
- AUR
  - AUR RPC v5 is used for search and details

## Files created

| File                   | Purpose                                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `official_index.json`  | Local cache of official packages (repo/name/arch/description)      |
| `details_cache.json`   | Package name ‚Üí detailed metadata used in Package Info              |
| `recent_searches.json` | Recent queries (deduped, MRU)                                      |
| `install_list.json`    | Persisted install queue                                            |
| `install_log.txt`      | Timestamped record of packages you initiated installs for          |

> Note: These default to the working directory; moving to XDG paths is planned.

## Troubleshooting
- Official details show empty fields
  - Ensure pacman is available and that `LC_ALL=C pacman -Si <pkg>` prints keys like ‚ÄúName‚Äù, ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù. Pacsea enforces `LC_ALL=C` for its pacman calls.
- AUR search errors
  - Check network connectivity (AUR RPC is online).
- Installs don‚Äôt start
  - Pacsea uses `sudo pacman` for official installs and `paru`/`yay` for AUR. If no terminal emulator is found, it falls back to `bash`.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Configurable paths (XDG) and settings
- [ ] Additional fields in Package Info
- [ ] AUR README/PKGBUILD inline preview
- [ ] Optional mouse support
- [ ] Prebuilt binaries / packaging
