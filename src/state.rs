//! Core application state types for Pacsea's TUI.
//!
//! This module defines the serializable data structures used across the
//! application: package descriptors, search coordination types, UI focus and
//! modals, and the central [`AppState`] container mutated by the event and UI
//! layers. Many of these types are persisted between runs.
