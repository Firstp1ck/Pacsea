Do we need to add missing i18n translation keys for all locales? 

Check codebase and last few changes. 

Add a TODO for hu-HU translations with english placeholder, if needed.

Use dev/scripts/check_translation_keys.py to check for internally missing translation keys for all locales. (If missing codewise add the missing keys to the locales files)
