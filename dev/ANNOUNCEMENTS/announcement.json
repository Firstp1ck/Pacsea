  "content": "IMPORTANT: A recent pacman update upgraded libalpm from version 15 to 16, which can cause yay and paru AUR helpers to fail until they are updated.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Package updates and installations via yay/paru may fail\n- This affects all Arch Linux users relying on these AUR helpers\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Update yay: The latest yay release is compatible. Update via: `pacman -Syu` then rebuild from AUR if needed\n- Update paru: Ensure you're running the latest version compatible with libalpm v16\n\n**Why this matters for Pacsea users:**\nSince Pacsea integrates with AUR helpers, this compatibility issue directly affects package management functionality. Make sure your AUR helpers are up-to-date to avoid update failures.\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1plnucq/psa_yay_paru_updates_may_fail/\n\n**Note:** Avoid workarounds like linking older libalpm versions, as these are not proper solutions and may cause further issues.",
