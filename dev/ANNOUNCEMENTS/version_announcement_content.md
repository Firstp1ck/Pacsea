## What's New

- TUI install/update/downgrade operations can use passwordless sudo when configured
- Same behavior as CLI: no password prompt when sudo allows it
- Remove operations always ask for password for safety
- Opening config files now uses your `VISUAL` or `EDITOR` environment variable
- Edit settings, theme, and keybinds in your preferred editor
